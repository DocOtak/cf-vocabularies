# Vocabularies

This repository is for the CF controlled vocabularies (standard names and canonical units, area types and the standardized region list).

Proposals for new terms or modifications to existing terms should be made by opening a new issue. A template called 'Standard Names' is available to use for this purpose.

Questions relating to any of the vocabularies can also be posed by opening a new issue.
